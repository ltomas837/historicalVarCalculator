# Historical VaR Calculator

This project is the first version of this [application](https://github.com/ltomas837/historicalVarPortfolioCalculator).

Given the fact this is not the last version delivered - treating only the first section of the exercise, which means the historical VaR of a single item - the code has not been totally clear, and the tests, the comments, the documentation and the package has not been done to focus on the last version.

The GUI, the use and the functionalities are similar to the last version, the documentation provided is sufficient.
